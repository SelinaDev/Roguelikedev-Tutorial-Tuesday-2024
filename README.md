# Roguelikedev Tutorial Tuesday 2024
 
This is the repository for my entry for the [2024 installment of the Tutorial Tuesday event on the subreddit /r/roguelikdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/1dt8bqm/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/).

## Web Build

You can a web-playable version on itch.io: https://selinadev.itch.io/roguelikedev-tutorial-tuesday-2024
The web-build is playable by 1-2 players. The game works with keyboard or controller input (in split-screen mode only one player can use keyboard input).
